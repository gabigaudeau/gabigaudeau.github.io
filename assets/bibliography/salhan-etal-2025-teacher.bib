    abstract = "Multi-turn dialogues between a child and caregiver are characterized by a property called contingency {--} prompt, direct, and meaningful exchanges between interlocutors. We introduce ContingentChat, a Teacher{--}Student framework that benchmarks and improves multi-turn contingency in a BabyLM trained on 100M words. Using a novel alignment dataset for post-training, BabyLM generates responses that are more grammatical and cohesive. Experiments with adaptive Teacher decoding strategies show limited additional gains. ContingentChat highlights the positive benefits of targeted post-training on dialogue quality and presents contingency as a challenging goal for BabyLMs."
