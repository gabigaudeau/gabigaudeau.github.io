## about

Hello! My name is Gabrielle and I am a 2<sup>nd</sup> Year PhD student in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning at the [Department of Computer Science and Technology at the University of Cambridge](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk), supervised by [Prof. Paula Buttery](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pjb48/), and co-supervised by [Dr. Andrew Caines](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~apc38/) and [Dr. Ã˜istein Andersen](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/people/oa223). I am an active member of the [Institute for Automated Language Teaching and Assessment (ALTA)](https://alta.cambridgeenglish.org) supported by [Cambridge University Press & Assessment](https://www.cambridge.org).

My current research interests sit at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Education, where I focus on Automated Essay Scoring and Essay Feedback Generation. More generally, I love learning about how we can make AI more explainable, as well as more human-centered, responsible and ethical--topics that I am always very keen on discussing. At the moment, I am really concerned about the impact that AI is having and will have on Education in the wake of Large Language Models (LLMs), and I really hope to be able to contribute to this area positively.
